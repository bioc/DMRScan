Description: This package detects significant differentially methylated regions
    (for both qualitative and quantitative traits), using a scan statistic with
    underlying Poisson heuristics. The scan statistic will depend on a sequence of
    window sizes (# of CpGs within each window) and on a threshold for each window
    size. This threshold can be calculated by three different means: i) analytically
    using Siegmund et.al (2012) solution (preferred), ii) an important sampling as
    suggested by Zhang (2008), and a iii) full MCMC modeling of the data, choosing
    between a number of different options for modeling the dependency between each
    CpG.
