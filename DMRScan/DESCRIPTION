Description: This package detects significant differentially methylated regions (for both qualitative and quantitative traits), 
    using a scan statistic with underlying Poisson heuristics. The scan statistic will depend on a sequence of window sizes 
    (# of CpGs within each window) and on a threshold for each window size. This threshold can be calculated by three different
    means: i) analytically using Siegmund et.al (2012) solution (preferred), ii) an important sampling as suggested by Zhang (20xx), 
    and a iii) full MCMC modeling of the data, choosing between a number of different options for modeling the dependency between 
    each CpG.
